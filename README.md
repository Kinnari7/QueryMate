# QueryMate

Developed an interactive web application enabling users to query SQL databases using natural language commands. Leveraged large language models (LLMs) to interpret and convert user input into SQL queries, integrating with OpenAI's API for robust language processing. Implemented real-time database querying with user-friendly results display, streamlining data access for non-technical users. Deployed and managed environment configurations to securely handle API keys and database connections.
